For this project, we wanted to create a LED Prop Module by creating a battery powered PCB with a microcontroller, LEDs, an accelerometer, and buttons ,which would be enclosed in a clear capsule. 
Both of us are members of the Olin Fire Arts Club, and enjoy springing and performing with fire. Spinning fire is dangerous, and fire props are delicate, so we try to avoid practicing and trying new tricks with them. The solution to this is an LED version of the prop that is more durable and less dangerous than fire props, but is still exciting and aesthetic, so it can be used to perform with if desired.
This project requires a board with a battery management system, bright RGBW LEDs, an accelerometer (to react to the movements of spinning), a button to change modes, and a microcontroller that can run the code to make all of these work. As a stretch goal, we also wanted to add a bluetooth module to the board so we could connect and sync the colors and patterns of multiple modules. 


This repository holds the [Software](Software/), [Electrical](Electrical/)and [CAD](CAD/) files required to fabricate and assemble the board and casing designed by us and teh code to run the Prop Module. It also has our [Report](Report.pdf) detailing how we designed and built the Prop module.
